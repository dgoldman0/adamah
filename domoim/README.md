# Domoim - Extended Friend and Family Households with Integrated Services and Economics

## Background History

The Roman domus offers an early example of a household system organized around pronounced hierarchy and concentrated authority. As a microcosm of Roman social order, a domus incorporated family members, dependents, enslaved laborers, and clients into a single economic unit governed by the paterfamilias, whose legal and social power shaped every dimension of domestic life. This structure provided stability through centralized control and longstanding patronage ties, though it also created vulnerabilities by placing the household’s functioning in the hands of one dominant figure.

In contrast, the kibbutzim of Israel represent a modern intentional community built on egalitarian ideals. These cooperative settlements emphasize shared labor, communal resource management, and collective decision-making, seeking to dissolve class divisions and cultivate mutual responsibility. Members typically work in agriculture, manufacturing, or service sectors owned by the collective, aligning personal livelihood with communal welfare. Their endurance stands out among communal experiments, supported by adherence to internal egalitarian principles alongside participation in a broader market economy that granted technological access, diversified income streams, and economic resilience.

Both the Roman domus and the Israeli kibbutz express cohesive social organization, yet they do so through contrasting logics that come with clear advantages and drawbacks. The domus achieved unity through hierarchy, a structure that offered the benefits of firm direction, defined responsibilities, and a stable household economy under the paterfamilias. Its liabilities stemmed from that same concentration of authority: the household’s welfare depended heavily on one person’s judgment, and the system reinforced stark inequalities.

Kibbutzim, by contrast, cultivate cohesion through shared purpose and collective governance, yielding strengths such as broad participation, social equality, and the ability to spread economic risk across the community. Their challenges emerge from the demands of maintaining consensus, the need for ongoing ideological commitment, and the pressures of adapting communal norms to changing economic realities. Considered together, the long-gone domus and the still-active kibbutz model demonstrate how stability can arise from either centralized leadership or cooperative organization, each carrying its own blend of benefits and constraints.e house's members to 

## Constructing the Domo (House)

While there are many designs that work for cooperative living, and many paradigms are repeated over and over again, it is interesting that the Roman domus is rather unique in its single physical household as a microcosm of Rome itself. The kibbitzim meanwhile show a sustainable blend of cooperative living and integration with the broader economy. What if we were to take the best elements of the domus and bring them forawrd, while maintaining a highly cooperative social and economic framework of the kibbitzim? Using technology to blend the two ideas makes it fully possible.

### Automation

Automation is key to the success of the modern domo. A fundamental moral failure of the original system the reliance on slaves. While these slaves were generally paid wages, often purchased their own freedom, and continued to manage the associated business side of the domus, it was still slavery. And many argue that relying on employees, especially while a person needs a job to survive, is still wage slavery. In a cooperative based system like the kibbutz, member provided labor fills the gap. However, members are thus required to provide labor, often being assigned given roles when they might wish to do something else. In many ways, this setup leaves all cooperative members as mutual slaves of the system. 

A major drawback of many cooperatives is the need to fill a given role in the cooperative. It's often why cooperatives fall apart. The members don't want the cooperative to become their job. While automation, including AI based automation, is a threat when wielded by megacorporations, it has the ability to free cooperative members from the need to labor in order to maintain functionality. A modern domo can therefore be built to serve the members of the house without the need for the system to demand labor input from its members, and without becoming an employer itself.
