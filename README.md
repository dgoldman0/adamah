# Adamah - A Constructed Nation for the World

Adamah is a constructed nation built to prototype applying modern technolies to solve current and emerging conflicts between current national infrastructure and the people of the nations that the infrastructure is supposed to manage. It replaces most top down organizational structure with skills and knowledge based cooperative infrastructure, including national ministries, true guilds, and cooerative economics based extended friends and family households.

## Triad Design

Three separate components together allow Adamah to function as a coherent national infrastructure paradigm. 

- National Guilds which manage everyday tasks of the nation based on their skill area while also acting as national stewards of their crafts.
- Embassy/Consulate System - Serve for onboarding, access to immediate services, and serve as negotiating bodies with other nations.
- Domoim - Cooperative based extended friend and family households.
