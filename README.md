# Adamah - A Constructed Nation for the World

Adamah is a constructed nation built to prototype applying modern technolies to solve current and emerging conflicts between current national infrastructure and the people of the nations that the infrastructure is supposed to manage. It replaces most top down organizational structure with skills and knowledge based cooperative infrastructure, including national ministries, true guilds, and cooerative economics based extended friends and family households.

## Triad Design

Adamah’s national infrastructure rests on a triad of interlinked components that reinforce one another to create a flexible, community-centered system. National [guilds](https://github.com/dgoldman0/adamah/blob/main/guilds/README.md) form the technical and cultural backbone, bringing together practitioners who steward their crafts, train new talent, and sustain essential skills for society’s daily functions. Their cooperative structure ensures that expertise remains community-owned and continuously renewed.

Alongside them, the embassy and consulate system provides a practical interface with the wider world. These sites offer onboarding, direct access to essential services, and a means of advocating within existing legal frameworks. By doing so, they secure basic income, support, and representation for citizens wherever they live, allowing a cooperative national model to operate effectively amid conventional state systems.

Interwoven with both is the network of [domoim](https://github.com/dgoldman0/adamah/blob/main/domoim/README.md), extended households that anchor people socially and economically. Each domoim functions as a small, supportive community able to pool labor, share resources, and offer stability to members, whether they are settled or nomadic. Because individuals can belong to more than one domoim, these households create a flexible web of care that connects seamlessly to guilds and embassies, completing a structure in which everyday life, professional stewardship, and national coordination work as a unified whole.
