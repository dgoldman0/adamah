# First National “Rangers” Guild of Adamah

A **member-owned cooperative** uniting practitioners at the crossroads of ecology, design, and civic stewardship.
Our guild brings together conservationists, land stewards, foragers, designers, and systems thinkers working to integrate living landscapes with modern human settlements.

## Purpose

The guild exists to:

* **Restore** degraded ecosystems and support the recovery of native biodiversity.
* **Design** regenerative urban and rural systems that balance ecology, infrastructure, and human need.
* **Educate** communities in sustainable foraging, agriculture, and stewardship practices.
* **Sustain** cooperative partnerships that model resilience and shared responsibility.

## Why “Rangers”?

To range is to move between—between forest and street, field and city, wildness and design.
Rangers operate within that threshold, bridging ecology and civilization.
They are stewards, educators, and builders: tending living systems while planning for long-term balance.

A Ranger’s craft is both practical and philosophical—combining ecological science, cultural knowledge, and civic cooperation to guide land and people toward mutual thriving.

## What We Will Do

* Lead habitat restoration and green infrastructure projects
* Maintain living systems within cities: rain gardens, pollinator corridors, and urban forests
* Train communities in foraging, safety, and sustainable harvesting
* Develop tools and educational materials for conservation planning
* Build partnerships across municipalities, nonprofits, and enterprises
* Support members through shared contracts, training, and mutual aid

## Materials

Curriculum will be developed collaboratively to support ecological literacy and applied fieldwork.

## Membership

Membership is open to anyone working or studying in the overlapping fields of ecology, landscape design, conservation, urban planning, environmental education, or foraging.
From professional consultants to community volunteers, each member strengthens the guild’s capacity to steward living systems responsibly and beautifully.

## Community Values

* **Stewardship** – Care for land, species, and community as interconnected systems
* **Cooperation** – Work across disciplines and jurisdictions toward shared goals
* **Education** – Empower others through skill-sharing and transparent practice
* **Resilience** – Design systems that endure and adapt over generations
* **Respect** – Honor the living world as teacher and partner

## Contributing

Members may contribute by:

* Leading or assisting with restoration and design projects
* Developing ecological management or education materials
* Mentoring apprentices or coordinating local chapters
* Sharing data, techniques, or foraging knowledge
* Representing the guild in municipal, civic, or academic partnerships

## Vision

To cultivate a network of skilled land stewards capable of shaping the built world in harmony with the natural one.
Through cooperation, education, and applied ecological design, the Rangers Guild seeks to ensure that every settlement of Adamah remains vibrant, biodiverse, and alive.
