# Guilds

**Definition:** A guild is a member-owned cooperative built around a trade or craft, dedicated to preserving the skill, teaching new talent, pushing its boundaries, and sustaining its community.

## Guild Association

The Guild Association is a central cooperative that supports the formation and management of guilds, ensuring that they perform their tasks as stewards of skills and crafts and supporters of those who love them. 

## National Guilds

National guilds form a core element of the Adamah triad paradigm, serving as stewards of the craft or trade within their domain. They also provide the backbone of basic education for the members of the Adamah nation, ensuring that members have a broad, extensive, liberal education that gives them an understanding of the world around them and how they can take part in managing that world.

## Guild Infrastructure

Guild DAO: https://github.com/dgoldman0/guild_dao

Currently in prototype stage, the guild DAO framework makes it easy to build goverance and economic models for guilds, using a multi-tiered voting system, and community invite and promotion model. 

## Guild Domains

### Tinkerers

Tinkerers shape the world through invention and hands-on creativity. They design, adapt, and assemble solutions that have never existed before. Their curiosity fuels tools, devices, and systems that help build new infrastructure and answer the challenges of today and tomorrow. Wherever something must be imagined, tested, and made real, Tinkerers lead the way. And therefore the tinkerers domain is centrally important to building out the base infrastructure of Adamah.

### Healers

Healers support the wellbeing of people and communities. Even with modern advances, many forms of suffering persist—rooted in lifestyle, inequity, and disconnection from one another. Healers address physical, emotional, social, and spiritual health through diverse practices that strengthen the foundation of a thriving society. Their work reminds us that every collective endeavor depends on the vitality of its people.

### Alchemists

Alchemists embody the ancient pursuit of transformation. Though metaphysical alchemy has given way to modern science, the essential act of reshaping matter—and ourselves through the process—remains an interesting goal. And there is one craft, or set of crafts, that embodies this craft, even if through convergent evolution. The alchemists domain unites brewers, vintners, meadmakers, distillers, cheesemakers, sourdough stewards, and all other "transmogrifiers of matter," who fundamentally transform raw ingredients into something new, generally using living organisms to do so.
