# The First National Tinkerers Guild of Adamah  
## Examination & Learning Materials Index

Welcome to the central index for the Guild’s developing body of assessments, draft examinations, and theoretical study guides.  
Each document below contributes to the Guild’s mission: **preserving the craft, teaching new makers, expanding the frontier of practical knowledge, and strengthening the fellowship of tinkerers across Adamah.**

These materials reflect the three pillars valued by the Guild:

1. **Foundational Competence** — essential literacy in tools, observation, reasoning, and safe practice.  
2. **Theoretical Depth** — understanding systems, abstractions, mechanisms, and the elegant principles beneath hands-on work.  
3. **Evolving Mastery** — the disciplined curiosity and experimental mindset that defines the modern tinkerer.

## 🎓 Purpose of This Collection

These assessment materials serve several roles within the Guild:

- **Teaching:** Helping apprentices measure their progress and identify areas for growth.  
- **Preservation:** Capturing the theoretical foundations of tinkering so they remain part of the Guild’s living tradition.  
- **Advancement:** Encouraging members to push past rote technique into thoughtful, principled craftsmanship.  
- **Community:** Providing shared reference points for study, discussion, and mentorship.

The documents in this directory are living texts — shaped by member insight, refined through collective practice, and continuously updated as the craft evolves.
