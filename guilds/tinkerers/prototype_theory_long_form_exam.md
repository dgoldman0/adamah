# **TINKERER LITERACY 101 — THEORY EXAM (LONG FORM)**

## **SECTION A — Conceptual Reasoning (10 questions)**

**Short explanations or definitions.**

1. **Define a “system boundary”** in the context of a device or mechanism.
   What does shifting the boundary reveal about understanding how something works?

2. **Explain emergent behavior** and give an example of how simple interacting parts can produce an unexpected outcome in a mechanism.

3. **Describe the difference between a constraint and a degree of freedom** in a physical assembly.
   How does misunderstanding these lead to instability in designs?

4. **What is a “design intention”** and how does it help a tinkerer interpret the purpose behind a component that seems unnecessary?

5. **Explain what an energy flow model is** and how it helps diagnose inefficiency or failure points in mechanical or electrical systems.

6. **Define a “failure mode”** and describe why identifying *latent* failure modes matters during modification.

7. **Describe statefulness** in physical systems.
   Give an example of something that “remembers” past conditions even when you don’t expect it to.

8. **Explain proportional vs. threshold responses** in system behavior.
   Why does distinguishing these two matter when predicting outcomes?

9. **What is the concept of abstraction layering** and how does it apply to both electronics and mechanical assemblies?

10. **Explain reversibility** in modifications.
    Why do some tinkering actions reduce reversibility, and how does that affect experimentation?

## **SECTION B — Analytical Scenarios (10 questions)**

**Answer by reasoning from first principles.**

11. A mechanism operates perfectly when cold but fails as it warms.
    Without naming tools or materials, describe **three abstract variables** that could explain temperature-dependent behavior.

12. A circuit appears to work only when a hand is near it.
    Explain this phenomenon using **field interaction**, **human-body coupling**, or **environmental sensitivity**.

13. You open a device and see an oddly shaped bracket that appears overbuilt.
    Provide three **theoretical justifications** for intentionally “overbuilding” a structural element.

14. A feedback loop in a system produces oscillations.
    Using abstraction only, describe **conditions that create oscillation** and **methods to damp it**.

15. A mechanical linkage has six joints but only five meaningful movements.
    Explain this situation using concepts of **redundancy**, **geometric dependency**, or **overconstraint**.

16. You observe that a simple two-part interface repeatedly wears in one direction.
    Discuss why **symmetry assumptions** often fail in real systems.

17. You’re comparing two designs: one with many small tolerances and one with a few large tolerances.
    Explain the **theoretical advantages and tradeoffs** of each approach.

18. A system fails only when two independent events overlap in time.
    Analyze how **timing interactions** and **hidden coupling** can produce rare or intermittent faults.

19. A device contains an intentional gap between two components that “does nothing” at first glance.
    Describe **three abstract reasons** why designed emptiness or slack space may be essential.

20. A simple structure collapses after you remove a single insignificant-looking screw.
    Explain how **load distribution** and **hidden dependencies** can amplify the role of small components.

## **SECTION C — Higher-Order Theory (10 questions)**

**Abstract essays (2–3 paragraphs each ideal).**

21. Discuss how **entropy** manifests in human-made systems.
    Explain why tinkering requires constantly counteracting drift toward disorder.

22. Compare **local optimization** vs. **global optimization** in design revision.
    Why can improving one part sometimes worsen overall system behavior?

23. Elaborate on the idea of **interface trust**:
    how system modules assume specific behaviors from other modules.
    Explore how tinkering disrupts trust and how to restore it.

24. Explore the principle of **functional duality**, where one component handles two unrelated roles.
    Why is this efficient, and why does it also increase fragility?

25. Describe the abstract concept of **model friction**—gaps between the tinkerer’s mental model and the system’s true behavior.
    Explain how model friction shapes diagnostic difficulty.

26. Examine how **nonlinearity** in a system can lead to disproportionate effects.
    Discuss the implications for experimental changes during tinkering.

27. Define **path dependence** in engineered systems.
    How do past design decisions limit or shape future possible modifications?

28. Discuss the tension between **predictability** and **adaptability** in engineered objects.
    Why can increasing one reduce the other?

29. Analyze how **latent structure** (such as hidden geometry or implicit signal paths) influences system behavior.
    How do tinkerers uncover and reason about these hidden layers?

30. Explain the concept of **robustness vs. sensitivity** in complex systems.
    Why is it impossible for a system to be maximally robust and maximally sensitive at the same time?
