# First Epicureans Guild of Adamah

A **member-owned philosophical and practical guild** devoted to cultivating pleasure wisely, sustainably, and in harmony with the material world.

The Epicureans Guild brings together individuals who understand pleasure as **quality of life**, **freedom from needless suffering**, and **careful enjoyment of what brings us joy**—personally, socially, and ecologically.

---

## Foundational Ethic

The Guild stands on two core principles inherited from the earliest Epicureans and adapted for a modern world:

1. **Pleasure is the highest good**  
   Pleasure is understood as a life well-lived: physical comfort, mental clarity, meaningful relationships, beauty, rest, nourishment, and security.

2. **Moderation is wisdom**  
   Lasting pleasure arises from restraint, discernment, and sustainability. Excess degrades enjoyment, erodes health, and destabilizes systems.

A modern Epicurean honors that which brings pleasure **without undermining future pleasure**—for oneself, for others, or for the land.

## Purpose

The Epicureans Guild exists to:

* **Cultivate quality of life** grounded in material reality, bodily health, and mental tranquility.
* **Promote sustainable pleasure** through moderation, durability, and respect for limits.
* **Defend freedom from unnecessary suffering**, fear, and artificial scarcity.
* **Integrate enjoyment with responsibility**, rejecting both ascetic denial and reckless indulgence.

## What “Epicurean” Means Here

An Epicurean of Adamah is one who:

* Chooses pleasures deliberately rather than compulsively
* Values comfort and happiness over luxury for the sake of luxury, sufficiency over accumulation for the sake of accumulation 
* Understands that peace of mind outweighs status or excess
* Seeks joy that can be shared with minimal harm
* Accepts material limits and designs life within them or works to rebuild the boundaries of material limits to sustainabily accomodate a desired life

Pleasure is treated as **something to be protected**, not consumed thoughtlessly. 

---

## Domains of Practice

Members of the Guild work across lived experience, culture, and material systems, including:

* Food, cultivation, and nourishment
* Design of humane living environments
* Community, friendship, and mutual support
* Craft, leisure, and aesthetic enjoyment

Epicurean practice always asks:  
*Does this increase durable pleasure, or merely stimulate desire?*
