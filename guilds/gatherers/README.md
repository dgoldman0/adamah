# First National Materials Gatherers Guild of Adamah

A **member-owned cooperative** devoted to the ethical sourcing, identification, harvesting, and preparation of natural materials.  
Our guild brings together foragers, mineral scouts, field collectors, ecological stewards, and material specialists who bridge landscapes and craft through skilled gathering.

## Purpose

The guild exists to:
- **Preserve** practical field knowledge of natural materials across biomes and disciplines.  
- **Teach** apprentices and practitioners the skills of identification, sourcing, and stewardship.  
- **Support** makers, builders, researchers, and artisans through reliable material supply.  
- **Sustain** ecosystems and communities through responsible gathering practices.  
- **Coordinate** shared tools, data, and labor in a cooperative structure.

## Why “Materials Gathering”?

Every craft begins upstream. Before a tool is shaped, a pigment ground, a structure raised, or a remedy prepared, someone must know **where materials come from**, **how to recognize them**, and **how to take them without harm**.

Materials gathering is the quiet discipline that underlies countless trades:
- Plants become fibers, medicines, dyes, foods, and fuels.  
- Stone becomes tools, shelter, pigments, and aggregate.  
- Clay becomes vessels and kilns.  
- Resins, salts, soils, and metals move from landscape into use.  

This work demands observation, restraint, and long memory. It ties human activity to season, terrain, and regeneration. The guild exists to keep this knowledge accurate, shared, and grounded in reality rather than abstraction.

## What We Will Do

- Train members in plant, mineral, and material identification  
- Establish best practices for sustainable harvesting and extraction  
- Maintain shared field tools, reference libraries, and sample archives  
- Conduct field surveys and material mapping projects  
- Document traditional, regional, and experimental sourcing methods  
- Supply guilds and members with responsibly gathered materials  
- Support members pursuing commercial, research, or subsistence work  

## Scope of Practice

Guild knowledge includes:
- Botanical foraging and fiber sourcing  
- Mineral, rock, and clay identification  
- Basic gemological field recognition  
- Ecological literacy and conservation principles  
- Low-impact extraction and harvesting methods  
- Primary processing, preservation, and storage  
- Legal, ethical, and cultural considerations of sourcing  

## Materials

Early educational resources are in development, including:
- Entry-level identification assessments  
- Field safety and ethics primers  
- Seasonal harvesting guides  
- Regional material catalogs  

These materials will be expanded collaboratively and maintained as living documents.

## Membership

Membership is open to practitioners and learners engaged in material sourcing, field collection, or related support roles, who are members of the Adamah Constructed Nation.

Whether you are learning plant identification, scouting clay deposits, or supplying materials for multiple crafts, the guild thrives through shared discipline and mutual reliance.

## Community Values

- **Accuracy** – Correct identification and honest reporting  
- **Stewardship** – Leave systems intact and regenerative  
- **Discipline** – Gather with intent, not excess  
- **Transparency** – Track source, method, and impact  
- **Cooperation** – Share labor, tools, and knowledge  
- **Respect** – For land, law, culture, and future need  

## Contributing

Members may contribute by:
- Sharing field notes, surveys, or sourcing data  
- Teaching workshops or guiding field sessions  
- Maintaining tools, archives, or shared equipment  
- Assisting apprentices and new members  
- Participating in cooperative harvesting projects  

## Vision

To build a durable institution that reconnects craft to landscape, ensures ethical access to natural materials, and supports a resilient network of skilled gatherers whose work quietly underpins the wider community. May be expanded to include ethincal hunting and fishing which respects the impact humanity has on the environemnt and native populations.
