# First National “Alchemists” Guild of Adamah

A **member-owned cooperative** devoted to the crafts of fermentation, distillation, preservation, and transformation.  
Our guild brings together brewers, vintners, meadmakers, distillers, cheesemakers, and all other practitioners who guide raw ingredients through remarkable change.

## Purpose

The guild exists to:
- **Preserve** traditional knowledge and craft across fermentation, brewing, and other transformative arts.  
- **Teach** apprentices and newcomers, passing down both skill and philosophy.  
- **Innovate**, exploring new techniques, styles, and approaches.  
- **Sustain community**, providing a cooperative structure where members support one another economically, socially, and creatively.

## Why “Alchemy”?

Alchemy has always centered on transformation—of matter and of the self. Though its physical practices gave way to chemistry and later nuclear physics, its metaphysical thread faded with them, which is both beneficial and a loss: science rightly leads our understanding, yet the symbolic idea of inner change mirrored by outer transformation carries a meaningful resonance. These crafts preserve that feeling in a grounded way, because guiding living cultures to shape something new in each small, unique batch naturally invites a quiet shift within the maker as well.

- Grains become beer.  
- Grapes become wine.  
- Honey becomes mead.  
- Milk becomes cheese.  
- Fruits, herbs, fungi, and countless ingredients evolve into something entirely new.  

Through molds, yeasts, cultures, and carefully guided processes, inert materials find renewed purpose. These crafts **preserve food**, **sustain life**, and **express creativity**—all through transformation. In this way, the guild embodies the spirit of alchemy more than the metaphor alone can hold.

## What We Will Do

- Maintain shared equipment and communal production spaces
